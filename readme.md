# Helsinki Tennis Finder

helsinki-tennis-finder shows available slots in Smash, Tali and Puhos within 15 days.

## Motive?

It's very hard to find tennis slots in Helsinki these days. People book way in advance, but it happens that they cancel during the same day or a day before.

## Current state

Currently the program shows only available slots from Tuesday to Thursday and from 5PM to 7:30PM

## How to run

Assuming you have GIT, Node and Yarn/NPM installed

- Clone source code.
- Run `yarn install` in project root
- Run `node src/index.js` in project root

## Future development

- Make it more configurable (select time range, select days)
- Add notification service
